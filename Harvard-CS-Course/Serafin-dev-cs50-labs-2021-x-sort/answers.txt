sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: If we compare the running time of this 3 programs given a sorted file as parameter (Ej: sorted50000.txt), we should expect Bubble sort to outperform Selection Sort, but Merge Sort will be the fastest.

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: Because the program using this algorithm outperformed the other programs running time on every comparisson when given the same .txt file as parameter.
sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?: I deducted it because of the first explanation given in this file. Also, Selection sort outperforms Bubble sort in most of the cases.
